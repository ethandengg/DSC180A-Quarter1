# EV Charging EDA Project üöóüîãüåç

## Overview

This project's initiative explores trends in electric vehicle (EV) charging stations in the United States using data from the Alternative Fuel Data Center (AFDC) API. We aim to provide insights into the growth, distribution, and accessibility of EV infrastructure, supporting a more sustainable and eco-friendly future.

Through interactive visualizations, geospatial mapping, and data analysis, we uncover patterns that can inform policymakers, urban planners, and environmental enthusiasts about the current landscape of EV charging stations and potential areas for improvement.

Key Features

	‚Ä¢	Automated Data Retrieval: Fetches the latest alternative fuel station data from the AFDC API and saves it to a CSV format.
	‚Ä¢	Data Cleaning and Analysis: Processes raw data to filter out irrelevant entries and handle missing values, ensuring quality insights.
	‚Ä¢	Insightful Visualizations: Creates time-series plots, geospatial maps, and statistical summaries to identify trends and highlight key information.
	‚Ä¢	Geospatial Mapping with Folium: Integrates mapping capabilities to visualize station locations, helping users understand regional distribution.
	‚Ä¢	Modular Code Structure: Organized into separate modules for data retrieval, analysis, and visualization to ensure clean, maintainable code.

Project Goals

	‚Ä¢	Promote Awareness: Shed light on the availability of EV infrastructure in various regions across the U.S.
	‚Ä¢	Support Policy Development: Provide data-driven insights that can guide government decisions on expanding alternative fuel infrastructure.
	‚Ä¢	Encourage Sustainable Practices: Facilitate the adoption of eco-friendly fuels by making infrastructure data more accessible and comprehensible.

Technologies Used

	‚Ä¢	Python: Core language for data manipulation and analysis.
	‚Ä¢	Pandas: For data cleaning and processing.
	‚Ä¢	Matplotlib & Plotly: To create insightful and interactive time-series and statistical plots.
	‚Ä¢	Geopandas & Folium: To enable geospatial analysis and mapping.
	‚Ä¢	AFDC API: Source of alternative fuel station data.

# EV Charging EDA Project üöóüîãüåç

## Abstract

The adoption of electric vehicles (EVs) is a critical step toward reducing carbon emissions and promoting sustainable transportation. However, effective EV growth requires a well-distributed network of charging stations to meet demand. This project explores the distribution of EVs and charging infrastructure in California's SDGE territory using comprehensive DMV vehicle registration data and AFDC charger data. Existing analyses often focus on either vehicle adoption or charging station availability separately, overlooking their interdependence. Our work bridges this gap by conducting an exploratory data analysis (EDA) that visualizes EV-to-charger density per ZIP code and highlights potential disparities in infrastructure. Leveraging geospatial data, we illustrate regional patterns, identify underserved areas, and propose considerations for balancing EV adoption with infrastructure expansion. The results provide actionable insights for policymakers and stakeholders looking to optimize resource allocation to support the growth of EVs.

## Introdution

The shift toward electric vehicles (EVs) has accelerated in recent years, driven by environmental concerns, technological advancements, and supportive policies. California, a leader in clean energy initiatives, has witnessed significant growth in EV ownership. However, the success of this transition hinges not only on the number of EVs but also on the adequacy and distribution of charging infrastructure. This balance is critical in regions such as the SDGE (San Diego Gas and Electric) territory, where geographic and demographic factors influence accessibility.

Despite increased efforts to expand the charging network, gaps remain in understanding the relationship between EV density and charger availability at the local level. Previous studies have either concentrated on mapping EV adoption or assessing the coverage of charging stations but rarely addressed both aspects together. Our project aims to fill this gap by analyzing DMV vehicle registration data to quantify EV counts and combining this with AFDC charging station data to map charger density across ZIP codes within the SDGE service area.

I conducted exploratory data analysis (EDA) with geospatial, time-series, and scatter plots to visualize the distribution of EVs and chargers, uncover patterns, and identify areas that may lack sufficient charging infrastructure relative to vehicle demand. Through this approach, we highlight opportunities for targeted infrastructure investment and policy adjustments to support the equitable growth of EVs. The data-driven insights derived from this analysis serve as a valuable resource for local governments, utility companies, and urban planners striving to enhance the sustainability and accessibility of EVs.
